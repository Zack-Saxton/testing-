      "question": "Secured versus Unsecured Loans",
      "message": "Secured loans: A secured loan means you are pledging something of value as an assurance that your loan will be repaid according to the agreed terms and conditions. Assets such as cars can be used as collateral, and, in some instances, the lender can place a lien on the asset, which will remain until the loan has been paid in full, including interest and all applicable fees.It’s important to remember that if you are unable to repay a secured loan, the lender may be able to sell the pledged collateral to pay off all or part of the loan. Unsecured loans:Unsecured loans are loans that do not require the borrower to pledge any collateral. Unsecured loans are sometimes considered riskier because there is no property or assets to recover in event of default. If you have been turned down for an unsecured loan, you may still be able to obtain a secured loan if you have an asset that can be used as collateral."
